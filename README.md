# LIFE implementation

This repository implements the LIFE extinction risk methodology as published in [Eyres et al](https://www.cambridge.org/engage/coe/article-details/66866978c9c6a5c07a3e07fa). The code will generate maps that cover the impact to extinction risk in an area under the two scenarios: conversion of the land to arable use, and coversion of the land to pre-human.

## Running the code

The methodology is explained in more detail in [method.md](method.md), but there is also a script set up to just do an entire run of the pipeline in `./scripts/run.sh`.
